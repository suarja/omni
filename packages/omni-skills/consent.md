For ordinary skill changes, previously given clear approval for this exact plan counts; do not ask again. If approval is not already clear, present the plan and wait for a clear yes; no or unclear means do nothing. For `approval: "omni"`: Approval happens in Omni for the reason returned with the preview. Tell the user in one line, then call omni_apply; it returns pending while the request waits. Call it again with the same requestId; the request does not expire. If the user approves in Omni later, omni_receipt shows the result. Route every write through Omni preview, `omni_apply`, and its receipt.

For sharing or publishing, follow `omni-share`; author and fix skills only in the active workshop, never in a storefront.

Install external skills through Omni using `omni_list_external_library`, `omni_preview_install_external`, `omni_apply` and its receipt; never run `npx skills add` directly.
